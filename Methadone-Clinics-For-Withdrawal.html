                <p class="content3"> <p>A methadone or substance use disorder services (SUDS) clinic is a facility that provides medication for the treatment of opiate dependence. It is historically and most often methadone. But buprenorphine is becoming more common. Patients who are opioid dependent or have a history if opioid dependence should be treated with medically assisted drug therapy. Methadone, a Schedule II (USA) opioid analgesic that can also be prescribed for pain management, is also available. Methadone is a long-acting opioid, which can prolong the opioid withdrawal symptoms experienced by patients who have been on short-acting opioids like heroin. It also allows for detoxification. A physician must supervise patients receiving methadone in the United States. The opioid treatment program must be certified by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and registered to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>

<p>There are about 1500 federally-certified opioid treatment programs in the United States. There are generally two types, private and public, of methadone treatment centers. The public clinics are typically more affordable. There is usually a wait list because of the limited funding. Although private clinics are more costly, they usually have a short waiting list. The availability of methadone clinics is limited in many parts the United States. This can create problems for people who live far from a clinic and those seeking treatment. California, Maryland, New York and New Jersey have the greatest concentrations. All methadone treatment programs must register with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration and renew each year or every three years depending on the accreditation period. Methadone can only be dispensable if methadone clinics register with Drug Enforcement Administration. Although this is an option for adults, it is not available to anyone younger than 18.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics across the United States are subject to strict federal and state regulations. Before a patient can consent to receive treatment, they must be provided with sufficient information. This information includes the reasons for treatment and recommended treatment options, side effects and risks, as well rules that must follow to receive methadone treatments. Treatment planning is possible once the physician verifies that the patient has consented to be treated with methadone. Treatment planning can begin if the patient has shown evidence of an opioid addiction at least one year prior to admission. A clinical evaluation is necessary before the patient can be admitted for treatment. This will include questions about drug history, co-occurring disorders, impact of substance use on daily life, as well as information about the treatment goals. A medical examination is also performed. This includes a urine test, review of past health history, and a test that detects certain conditions in addiction populations like HIV, hepatitis or tuberculosis. The doctor prescribes the medication. The nursing staff monitors the medication. New York State&#39;s requirements for admission to methadone clinics has changed since 2013, as a result of changes in the prescription pain medication received and the decrease in non-medical prescription usage.</p>

                <p class="content4"> <p>Methadone clinics are able to provide methadone for on site administration. Some clinics offer additional services such as monitoring of treatment, observation, dosing and consultation, urine drug test, distribution of naloxone, mental health services and primary care, and HIV/HCV services.</p>

<p>Even though methadone does not require that treatment be provided, Americans are often encouraged to explore other methods of treating the condition before enrolling in methadone treatment programs. Methadone, which was first used in the 1960s, is still the preferred treatment method at clinics. However, it is often included in other protocols. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has a list of recommended treatment options for addiction, including medication assisted therapy, cognitive behavioral Therapy (CBT), medical detox and medical detox. Newer medications have been introduced that have fewer side-effects than methadone. They can be used to curb drug cravings and block opioid effects. CBT is a customized treatment plan that allows therapists explore patterns of drug abuse and helps to develop new behavior skills. Medical detox offers safety and comfort, as it provides ongoing monitoring until withdrawal symptoms subside.</p>

<p>Counselling is an important part of addiction treatment. Methadone clinics only serve those who have been addicted to opioids. The clinic requires that patients attend counseling groups and individual counseling sessions. It is generally agreed that the more intense the counseling the person is willing to receive, the higher the program&#39;s success rates. Prevention of HIV transmission and exposure is an important part of counseling. Clinics should have the ability to refer patients to community resources, vocational rehabilitation programs, education, work, and prenatal-care. Although there is not a set time limit for methadone treatment; longer treatments have better outcomes. When transferring to a community-based setting, patients who have received methadone treatment in closed settings should be supported. Patients who decide to discontinue methadone treatment should talk to their doctor.</p>

                <p class="content3">  <p>The placement of methadone Clinics is controversial. Although they are often considered effective treatment options for those suffering from opioid addiction, it is not clear if this is true in all cases. It is believed that the clinics will attract criminal activity to nearby areas. The University of Maryland School of Medicine has found that methadone clinics do not increase crime rates. GAO studies in 2004 have shown that clinics can be detrimental to recovery and worsen relapse.</p>

<p>&quot;These clinics are meant to assist those in rehabilitation. Patients who seek treatment must navigate their way from clinics to reach them in an environment where illegal sales of narcotics is a daily occurrence.&quot; This criminal activity is greatly hampering the efforts of both patients who seek rehabilitation and the clinic professionals who work with them.</p>

<p>Patients who stop taking methadone maintenance for a period of time will relapse between 70-80%. Due to the severity and long-term effects associated with opioid use, there may be a high relapse rate. Some patients remain on methadone for their entire lives. This is a criticism of the clinic&#39;s effectiveness. Advocates argue that clinics do not aim to cure narcotic dependence, but rather to make it easier for people to live a normal life.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics could decrease opioid-dependent patients&#39; need for emergency room visits. A 2009 Cochrane review found that methadone maintenance treatment reduced heroin dependence, but not increased crime or mortality. However, most of the research currently supports the hypothesis that methadone treatment can decrease overdose and related crime.</p>

<p>A lot of people are familiar with the concept of a methadone clinic thanks to its appearances on TV and movies. The average person will likely stare blankly at the concept of a methadone clinic if they ask them how it works or what it does. Methadone clinics may seem a bit mysterious to people who haven&rsquo;t been there. This can be nerve-wracking if someone you care for is thinking about this type of addiction treatment.</p>

                <p class="content6"> <p>There are many things you should know about methadone treatment. We have the answers to your questions.</p>

<p>Methadone, a long-acting opioid analgesic, is part of the opioid family. It is chemically very similar to opium. However, it is completely synthetic. A German group of scientists created methadone in 1930. The two scientists were originally looking for a painkiller which didn&#39;t have the addictive effects of morphine. Max Bockmhl (the scientist) and Gustav Ehrhart (the engineer) created the substance they call polamidon. A shortage of painkillers led to a different group of scientists synthesizing polamidon during World War II. The name was changed to methadone.</p>

<p>Methadone, a pain reliever that is effective in treating many conditions, was first introduced to the United States by Methadone in 1947. It became evident that methadone could be used to treat addictions to narcotics. Researchers were desperate to find a drug that could reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings due to the rise in heroin addiction during the 1960s. Methadone was the ideal drug.</p>

<p>Methadone helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and suppresses cravings for drugs for up to 24 hours. It does not cause any feelings of euphoria. This medication is typically taken for at most one year. It makes recovery more possible. Methadone maintenance is a type of methadone treatment.</p>

<p>The federal government established regulations in 1971 that allowed methadone to be used for heroin addiction. These regulations remained unchanged until 2001 when the regulations were amended to make it easier for doctors and other health-care professionals to administer methadone consistently to patients. Methadone maintenance is the gold standard in opioid addiction treatment.</p>

<p>Methadone acts as an opioid agonist by attaching to the brain&rsquo;s receptors for opioids. Methadone is a synthetic opioid which activates opioid receptors more slowly than other opioids. This helps with withdrawal symptoms and does not create a high for people who have an opioid addiction. It alters the brain&#39;s pain response, decreasing the pain experienced during opioid withdrawal. Methadone can also block the effects of opioids. This discourages people from using opioids to feel high.<br />

                <p class="content3"><p>A methadone clinic allows people who are addicted to opioids to get treatment. They can also receive the medication they need to help them recover. Because they can also dispense Suboxone(r) and naltrexone, methadone clinics could be called substance use disorder services (SUDS). But, methadone being the primary medication dispensabled, most people have come to associate the two terms.</p>

<p>All methadone clinics must receive certification from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and be registered with Drug Enforcement Agency. About 1,500 methadone-treatment clinics were registered in the U.S. in 2018, with most being located in New York and New Jersey.</p>

<p>There are two types, private and public, of methadone treatment centers. While public clinics are generally more affordable, they have limited government funding so people often end up on a waitlist. For an addiction as severe as addiction, the possibility of someone returning to treatment is greatly reduced if they have to wait for days or weeks.</p>

<p>While private clinics are more expensive, the benefits are still clear. A private clinic will often have no waiting list, or if it does, it will be very short. Private clinics provide better care, as staff and medical professionals are much less likely be overworked.</p>

<p>Clinics are required to meet certain federal requirements to gain certification in order for them to dispense methadone and other medications. All clinics must provide a minimum of the following services:</p>

<p>These are only the essential services a methadone clinic has to offer. These are the minimum requirements for clinics that provide methadone counseling. They also offer holistic services and other services.</p>

<p>Patients suffering from opioid addiction can come to a methadone clinic to request treatment. After the clinic has determined that the patient is eligible through interviews and initial screenings, methadone can be prescribed on-site. Some programs allow patients to self-manage their medication at home after they are approved.</p>
