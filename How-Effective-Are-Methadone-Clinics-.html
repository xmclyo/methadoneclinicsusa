                <p class="content3"> <p>A methadone (or substance-use disorder services clinic, also known as SUDS) clinic was established to dispense medications for the treatment or opiate dependence. Historically, this clinic has been primarily dedicated to methadone. However it is increasingly becoming prescribed buprenorphine. For patients who are opioid-dependent, or have a history with opioid dependence, medically assisted drug treatment is recommended. Methadone, which is an opioid analgesic of schedule II in the USA, can be used to manage pain. It is a long-acting opioid which can delay opioid withdrawal symptoms patients feel from using short-acting painkillers like heroin. Patients must be monitored by a doctor to receive methadone in the United States. It is administered through an opioid treatment program that has been certified by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>

<p>There are approximately 1500 United States methadone clinics which are federally approved to provide opioid treatment programs. There are two types generally of methadone clinics. It is generally less expensive to visit the public clinics. Due to limited funding, there may be a waiting list. Private clinics tend to be more expensive but often have a shorter or no waiting list. The availability of methadone clinics is limited in many parts the United States. This can create problems for people who live far from a clinic and those seeking treatment. California, Maryland New York, New Jersey, and New York have the largest concentrations. All methadone clinics must register with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration as an accredited opioid treatment program. They are required to renew their accreditation every three years or annually depending on the time period. Methadone can only be dispensable if methadone clinics register with Drug Enforcement Administration. This treatment option is available for adults only, but it is not recommended to be used by anyone under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics throughout the United States adhere to strict regulations set by federal and state laws. Before a patient can consent to receive treatment, they must be provided with sufficient information. This information includes the reasons for treatment and recommended treatment options, side effects and risks, as well rules that must follow to receive methadone treatments. Treatment planning is possible once the physician verifies that the patient has consented to be treated with methadone. Treatment planning can begin if the patient has shown evidence of an opioid addiction at least one year prior to admission. Before treatment can be administered, a clinical assessment is needed. It will ask about drug use history, coexisting disorders, and the effect of substance use. The evaluation also includes information about treatment goals, guidelines, and details about how to achieve them. Also, a medical evaluation includes a urinalysis, review of past and present health, and testing for certain conditions that are common in addict populations such as HIV, Hepatitis, or Tuberculosis. The physician prescribes the medication. Nursing staff monitors the patient and gives them their medications. New York State changed its requirements for admitting methadone patients to their clinics, due to strict changes in prescription pain medication use and decreases of non-medical prescriptions.</p>

                <p class="content4"> <p>Methadone clinics can offer methadone to be administered on-site. Some methadone clinics also offer the following services: supervision of treatment, monitored dosing, consultations, urine drug testing, naloxone distribution and mental health services.</p>

<p>Even though methadone does not require that treatment be provided, Americans are often encouraged to explore other methods of treating the condition before enrolling in methadone treatment programs. Methadone remains the preferred choice for treatment in clinics. The National Institute on Drug Abuse provides guidelines for how to treat addiction. These include medication assisted treatment (MAT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or medical detox. Newer medications have been introduced that have fewer side-effects than methadone. They can be used to curb drug cravings and block opioid effects. CBT is a customized treatment plan that allows therapists explore patterns of drug abuse and helps to develop new behavior skills. Medical detox is safe and comfortable. It provides long-term monitoring to ensure that withdrawal symptoms are under control.</p>

<p>Counselling is an essential part of addiction treatment. Methadone clinics only serve those who have been addicted to opioids. Individual counseling is required at clinics. It is generally agreed that the more intense the counseling the person is willing to receive, the higher the program&#39;s success rates. Prevention of HIV transmission and exposure is an important part of counseling. Patients should be referred to or provided with services by clinics, including community resources, vocational rehabilitation and education. Prenatal-care is also possible. Although there is no standard for the duration of methadone treatment (but it is recommended that longer treatment be done), better outcomes are often associated with them. Patients receiving methadone therapy in a closed setting need to be assisted in the transition to a community setting. Patients who decide to discontinue methadone treatment should talk to their doctor.</p>

                <p class="content3">  <p>Although methadone clinics are considered effective options for opioid addicts, particularly when other treatment fails, there is some controversy over the location of methadone centers. Some people believe that the clinics can attract crime to the area. A University of Maryland School of Medicine study found that crime rates don&#39;t increase when methadone clinics are opened. GAO 2004 Study notes that clinics may impede recovery or exacerbate relapse.</p>

<p>&quot;These clinics are designed to aid those in need of rehabilitation. However, patients must navigate the way to and from the clinics within an environment that allows illegal sales of drugs to continue to be a regular occurrence. Criminal activity surrounding patients seeking rehabilitation can severely hamper their efforts and those of clinic staff who provide them with treatment.</p>

<p>Relapse rates range from 70 to 90% for patients who have stopped taking methadone maintenance. A combination of the severity of methadone-related cases and long-term opioid use may explain the high relapse rate. Many patients continue to take methadone throughout their lives. This raises questions about the clinic&#39;s effectiveness. Supporters claim that the clinics not only aim to end narcotic dependency but also help patients function in their daily lives.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics may reduce the number of opioid addicts visiting emergency rooms. According to a 2009 Cochrane review methadone maintenance treatments reduced the likelihood that heroin dependent patients would turn to heroin but they did not increase crime or mortality rates. However, the majority of research suggests that methadone clinics may reduce overdoses and substance-related criminality.</p>

<p>Because of the many representations in TV and movies, most people know what a methadone treatment center is. But, most people will not know much about the clinic or how it operates. Methadone clinics may seem a bit mysterious to people who haven&rsquo;t been there. This can be nerve-wracking if someone you care for is thinking about this type of addiction treatment.</p>

                <p class="content6"> <p>There are many things you should know about methadone treatment. We have the answers to your questions.</p>

<p>Methadone is a long acting opioid analgesic. Although chemically similar to opium, it is entirely synthetic. In the 1930s, a group German scientists discovered methadone. At first, they were trying to find a painkiller that didn&#39;t have the addictive properties of morphine. Max Bockmhl (the scientist) and Gustav Ehrhart (the engineer) created the substance they call polamidon. The shortage of painkillers in World War II forced another team of scientists into synthesizing the compound. They changed the name to methadone.</p>

<p>Methadone arrived in the United States in 1947 as a pain relief medication that could be used to treat multiple conditions. It became evident that methadone could be used to treat addictions to narcotics. Researchers were desperate to find a drug that could reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings due to the rise in heroin addiction during the 1960s. Methadone was the perfect candidate.</p>

<p>Methadone helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and suppresses cravings for drugs for up to 24 hours. It does not cause any feelings of euphoria. Methadone maintenance is usually taken for at least one year to make recovery easier. This form of treatment is known as methadone maintenance.</p>

<p>The federal government officially recognized methadone as a recovery aid in 1971 by establishing regulations for its use in heroin addiction treatment. They remained basically the same until 2001 when certain modifications were made to enable doctors and other health professionals to give methadone to patients consistently. Methadone maintenance is the gold standard in opioid addiction treatment.</p>

<p>Methadone, an opioid agonist, attaches to the brain&#39;s opioid receptors. Methadone is a synthetic opioid which activates opioid receptors more slowly than other opioids. This helps with withdrawal symptoms and does not create a high for people who have an opioid addiction. It also alters the brain and nervous systems&#39; response to pain, thus reducing the pain people feel while they are in opioid withdrawal. Methadone can also block the effects of opioids. This discourages people from using opioids to feel high.<br />

                <p class="content3"><p>A methadone treatment center is where those suffering from opioid addiction can seek help. It provides medication that will aid them in their recovery journey. Because they can also dispense Suboxone(r) and naltrexone, methadone clinics could be called substance use disorder services (SUDS). Because methadone is often the first medication administered, these terms have become synonymous for most people.</p>

<p>All methadone clinics must receive certification from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and be registered with Drug Enforcement Agency. There were 1,500 methadone facilities in the U.S. as of 2018. The majority of them were in New York, New Jersey Maryland and California.</p>

<p>There are two types, private and public, of methadone treatment centers. The cost of a private clinic is less, but there is limited funding. This means that people end up on a waitinglist. If you have a serious addiction, waiting for treatment can significantly decrease the chances that a person will return and increase the likelihood that they won&rsquo;t get the help or support they need.</p>

<p>While private clinics are more expensive, the benefits are still clear. Private clinics have very few waiting lists and, if they do, there will be a shorter wait time. Private clinics provide better care, as staff and medical professionals are much less likely be overworked.</p>

<p>Clinics must fulfill specific federal requirements to obtain the certification required to dispense methadone and other treatments. All clinics must provide a minimum of the following services:</p>

<p>These are just a few of the services that a methadone clinic should offer. The best clinics provide holistic counseling as well as other services.</p>

<p>People with opioid addiction may walk into a methadone treatment center and ask to be treated. Once the clinic has confirmed that the patient is eligible, the patient can receive methadone directly on-site. Some programs allow patients with the right to take their medication home for self administration after they have been approved.</p>
