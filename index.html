                <p class="content3"> <p>A methadone clinic or substance abuse disorder services clinic (SUDS) is a clinic that dispensing medications to treat opiate dependence. Historically, most people have used methadone. However, buprenorphine has become more popular. If a patient is opioid-dependent or has a history of opioid dependence, medically assisted drugs therapy is indicated. Methadone, a Schedule II (USA) opioid analgesic that can also be prescribed for pain management, is also available. It is a long acting opioid that can reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms caused by short-acting opioids such as heroin and allows for detoxification. Patients must be monitored by a doctor to receive methadone in the United States. It is administered through an opioid treatment program that has been certified by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>

<p>There are approximately 1500 accredited opioid treatment programs that are federally licensed in the United States. There are generally two types, private and public, of methadone treatment centers. The public clinics tend to be more affordable. Because of limited funding, there is often a waitinglist. Private clinics tend to be more expensive but often have a shorter or no waiting list. Many methadone clinics are not available in all parts of the United States. This poses problems for methadone addicts who live far from a clinic. California, Maryland, New York and New Jersey have the greatest concentrations. All methadone clinics need to register as accredited opioid treatment programs with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration and then renew every year or three years, depending on how long the accreditation was granted. The Drug Enforcement Administration must be registered with methadone treatment centers before the medication can be given. This treatment is not only for adults, but it is not recommended for anyone under 18.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics throughout the United States adhere to strict regulations set by federal and state laws. Before a patient can consent to receive treatment, they must be provided with sufficient information. This information includes the reasons for treatment and recommended treatment options, side effects and risks, as well rules that must follow to receive methadone treatments. Once a doctor has verified that the patient consents to receiving treatment, treatment planning can start. Treatment planning can begin if the patient has shown evidence of an opioid addiction at least one year prior to admission. A clinical evaluation will be required before any treatment can start. This evaluation will cover drug use history and co-occurring diseases, as well the effects of substance usage on one&#39;s daily life. An additional medical evaluation may be performed in the form a urinalysis and review of past and current health. It will also include a test for certain conditions known to be common in addicts, such as HIV/hepatitis and tuberculosis. The prescription is made by a doctor and the medication is administered by nurses. New York State has changed the requirements for methadone clinic acceptance, mainly because of stricter guidelines regarding prescription pain medication and decreases in non-medical prescriptions.</p>

                <p class="content4"> <p>Methadone clinics can offer methadone to be administered on-site. Some methadone clinics also offer the following services: supervision of treatment, monitored dosing, consultations, urine drug testing, naloxone distribution and mental health services.</p>

<p>Although methadone use is not regulated in the United States currently, many people are encouraged to try different treatment methods before starting methadone treatment programs. Methadone has been the most popular treatment option at clinics since its introduction in 1960s. It is sometimes part of other protocols. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has a list of recommended treatment options for addiction, including medication assisted therapy, cognitive behavioral Therapy (CBT), medical detox and medical detox. Newer medications such as buprenorphine (and naltrexone) have been introduced to relieve drug cravings, prevent opioid withdrawals, and reduce physical dependence. CBT allows therapists the opportunity to look at patterns of addiction and develop alternative behaviour skills. Medical detox assures safety and comfort with long-term monitoring, until withdrawal symptoms have passed.</p>

<p>Counseling is an important part in addiction treatment. Methadone clinics can only be used by recovering addicts who are not addicted to opioids. These clinics require that clients attend counseling groups as well individual counseling contacts. It is generally agreed that the more intense the counseling the person is willing to receive, the higher the program&#39;s success rates. A key part of counseling is to prevent the transmission and exposure of HIV. Patients should be referred to or provided with services by clinics, including community resources, vocational rehabilitation and education. Prenatal-care is also possible. Although there is no established time limit for methadone treatments, patients who receive longer durations of treatment are likely to have better outcomes. When transferring to a community-based setting, patients who have received methadone treatment in closed settings should be supported. Patients who choose to stop receiving methadone treatment should consult their provider.</p>

                <p class="content3">  <p>Though methadone clinics have been widely accepted as effective treatment options for opioid-dependent patients, especially after other interventions fail, there are still questions about their placement. It is believed that the clinics will attract criminal activity to nearby areas. One study from the University of Maryland School of Medicine showed that crime rates do not rise when methadone clinics open. GAO studies in 2004 have shown that clinics can be detrimental to recovery and worsen relapse.</p>

<p>&quot;These clinics were created to provide rehabilitation services for those who are in need. Patients must navigate the environment where illegal narcotics sales are a regular occurrence to get to and from these clinics. This criminal activity surrounds patients seeking rehabilitation. It severely hinders the efforts of professionals and patients.</p>

<p>70% to 90% of methadone-treated patients will relapse after they stop using it. Partly, the high rate of relapse may be due to severe cases treated at methadone clinics and the long-term opioid effects. Patients may continue taking methadone for life, which can lead to criticisms about clinics&#39; effectiveness. Advocates argue that clinics do not aim to cure narcotic dependence, but rather to make it easier for people to live a normal life.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics could decrease opioid-dependent patients&#39; need for emergency room visits. A 2009 Cochrane review found that methadone maintenance treatment reduced heroin dependence, but not increased crime or mortality. However, most of the research currently supports the hypothesis that methadone treatment can decrease overdose and related crime.</p>

<p>A lot of people are familiar with the concept of a methadone clinic thanks to its appearances on TV and movies. The average person will likely stare blankly at the concept of a methadone clinic if they ask them how it works or what it does. Methadone clinics can be a little confusing for those who have never been. This can make it difficult to know what to expect when someone you love is looking into this type of treatment.</p>

                <p class="content6"> <p>You have many questions about methadone treatment. This guide can help you understand them all and make an informed decision on the right program for you.</p>

<p>Methadone is a long acting opioid analgesic. Methadone is chemically identical to opium but completely synthetic. In the 1930s, a group German scientists discovered methadone. The two scientists were originally looking for a painkiller which didn&#39;t have the addictive effects of morphine. Max Bockmhl (the scientist) and Gustav Ehrhart (the engineer) created the substance they call polamidon. A shortage of painkillers led to a different group of scientists synthesizing polamidon during World War II. The name was changed to methadone.</p>

<p>Methadone, a pain reliever that is effective in treating many conditions, was first introduced to the United States by Methadone in 1947. It was soon clear that methadone was effective in treating addictions. Due to a rise of heroin addiction in 1960s, researchers began searching for a substance to help with withdrawal symptoms. Methadone was the ideal drug.</p>

<p>Methadone relieves withdrawal symptoms. It can also suppress cravings up to 36 hours for drugs. This medication makes recovery easier and can be taken for at minimum one year. This form of treatment is known as methadone maintenance.</p>

<p>1971 saw the federal government recognize methadone&#39;s effectiveness as a treatment for heroin addiction. They created regulations that governed its use. They remained basically the same until 2001 when certain modifications were made to enable doctors and other health professionals to give methadone to patients consistently. Methadone maintenance treatment has become the gold standard in opioid addiction treatment.</p>

<p>Methadone acts as an opioid agonist by attaching to the brain&rsquo;s receptors for opioids. It is a synthetic opioid that activates opioids slower than other opioids. Therefore, it eases withdrawal symptoms but does not give rise to a high in opioid-using addicts. It can also alter the brain&#39;s and nervous system&#39;s responses to pain, reducing pain during opioid withdrawal. Methadone also blocks opioids&#39; effects, which discourages people from using opioids for high feelings.<br />

                <p class="content3"><p>A methadone facility is where opioid addicts can get medication to start their journey to recovery. The methadone clinics can also be dispensed Suboxone(r) and Naloxone(r). Since methadone, which is the primary medication, is used, both terms have been deemed synonymous.</p>

<p>All methadone clinics must receive certification from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and be registered with Drug Enforcement Agency. There were approximately 1,500 methadone clinics across the United States as of 2018. Most were located in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.</p>

<p>There are two types if methadone clinics - private and public. While public clinics are generally more affordable, they have limited government funding so people often end up on a waitlist. A serious issue like addiction can make it difficult for someone to return to treatment. It is also more likely that they will not get the help they need.</p>

<p>Although they are more expensive than public clinics, the benefits can also be clear. There is rarely a waiting list at private clinics, and if there are, it will usually be short. Private clinics provide better care, as staff and medical professionals are much less likely be overworked.</p>

<p>Clinics must fulfill specific federal requirements to obtain the certification required to dispense methadone and other treatments. Clinics must offer the following services:</p>

<p>These are just a few of the services that a methadone clinic should offer. Clinics that offer holistic counseling and multiple services go above and beyond this standard.</p>

<p>A methadone clinic can be accessed by anyone suffering from an opioid addiction. Patients can receive methadone at the clinic once they have established their eligibility via interviews and screening. Some programs allow patients the option to self-manage their medications at home once they have been granted this privilege.</p>
