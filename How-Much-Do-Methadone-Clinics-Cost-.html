                <p class="content3"> <p>A methadone (or substance-use disorder services clinic, also known as SUDS) clinic was established to dispense medications for the treatment or opiate dependence. Historically, this clinic has been primarily dedicated to methadone. However it is increasingly becoming prescribed buprenorphine. If a patient is opioid-dependent or has a history of opioid dependence, medically assisted drugs therapy is indicated. Methadone, which is an opioid analgesic of schedule II in the USA, can be used to manage pain. It is a long-acting opioid which can delay opioid withdrawal symptoms patients feel from using short-acting painkillers like heroin. Patients must be monitored by a doctor to receive methadone in the United States. It is administered through an opioid treatment program that has been certified by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>

<p>The United States has approximately 1500 methadone treatment centers that have been federally accredited. There are generally two types, private and public, of methadone treatment centers. The public clinics tend to be more affordable. Because of limited funding, there is often a waitinglist. Although private clinics are more costly, they usually have a short waiting list. There are very few methadone clinics in the United States. This presents problems for those who live far away from one. California, Maryland New York, New Jersey and New York are the most concentrated areas of clinics. All methadone clinics must register with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration as an accredited opioid treatment program. They are required to renew their accreditation every three years or annually depending on the time period. Methadone can only be dispensable if methadone clinics register with Drug Enforcement Administration. This treatment method is usually not suitable for children under the age 18.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics in America are subject to strict regulation by both federal and state laws. Patients must have all the information they need to be able to consent to treatment. This information includes the reasons for treatment and recommended treatment options, side effects and risks, as well rules that must follow to receive methadone treatments. Treatment planning is possible once the physician verifies that the patient has consented to be treated with methadone. It is necessary that the patient can show evidence of opioid dependence at least one (1) year prior to treatment. A clinical evaluation will be required before any treatment can start. This evaluation will cover drug use history and co-occurring diseases, as well the effects of substance usage on one&#39;s daily life. Also, a medical evaluation includes a urinalysis, review of past and present health, and testing for certain conditions that are common in addict populations such as HIV, Hepatitis, or Tuberculosis. The physician prescribes the medication. Nursing staff monitors the patient and gives them their medications. New York State changed its requirements for admitting methadone patients to their clinics, due to strict changes in prescription pain medication use and decreases of non-medical prescriptions.</p>

                <p class="content4"> <p>Methadone clinics are able to provide methadone for on site administration. A number of methadone clinics offer services including supervision, monitoring, prescriptions, consultation services, urine drug tests, naloxone delivery, mental health, HIV and HCV treatment, as well as primary care and HIV services.</p>

<p>Even though it is not required by law in the United States at this point, patients are encouraged to try other treatment options before deciding to enter methadone treatment programs. Methadone remains the preferred choice for treatment in clinics. The National Institute on Drug Abuse offers a guideline for addiction treatment. This includes medication-assisted treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy and medical detox. Newer medications, such as buprenorphine or naltrexone, have been developed to reduce drug cravings and prevent physical dependence. CBT is a customized treatment plan that allows therapists explore patterns of drug abuse and helps to develop new behavior skills. Medical detox assures safety and comfort with long-term monitoring, until withdrawal symptoms have passed.</p>

<p>Counselling is an essential part of addiction treatment. Methadone clinics should only be opened to addicts suffering from an addiction to opioids. These clinics require that clients attend counseling groups as well individual counseling contacts. It is common knowledge that the more intense counseling contacts an individual is willing or able to provide, the higher his success rate in the program. A key part of counseling is to prevent the transmission and exposure of HIV. Clinics should have the ability to refer patients to community resources, vocational rehabilitation programs, education, work, and prenatal-care. Although there is no standard for the duration of methadone treatment (but it is recommended that longer treatment be done), better outcomes are often associated with them. Patients who are receiving methadone treatment should be assisted in moving to a community-based setting. Patients who choose to stop receiving methadone treatment should consult their provider.</p>

                <p class="content3">  <p>The placement of methadone Clinics is controversial. Although they are often considered effective treatment options for those suffering from opioid addiction, it is not clear if this is true in all cases. Some people believe that the clinics can attract crime to the area. According to a University of Maryland School of Medicine study, crime rates do NOT increase when methadone treatment clinics are open. GAO studies in 2004 have shown that clinics can be detrimental to recovery and worsen relapse.</p>

<p>&quot;These clinics are meant to assist those in rehabilitation. Patients who seek treatment must navigate their way from clinics to reach them in an environment where illegal sales of narcotics is a daily occurrence.&quot; This criminal activity surrounds patients seeking rehabilitation. It severely hinders the efforts of professionals and patients.</p>

<p>70% to 90% of methadone-treated patients will relapse after they stop using it. Due to the severity and long-term effects associated with opioid use, there may be a high relapse rate. Some patients are able to continue using methadone into adulthood, which raises questions about their effectiveness. Supporters claim that the clinics not only aim to end narcotic dependency but also help patients function in their daily lives.</p>

<p>Methadone clinics could decrease opioid-dependent patients&#39; need for emergency room visits. A 2009 Cochrane review found that methadone maintenance treatment reduced heroin dependence, but not increased crime or mortality. Research supports the idea that methadone clinics can reduce overdose and drug-related crime.</p>

<p>Due to the widespread representation on TV and movies, most people have heard of methadone clinics. Most people aren&#39;t aware of how these clinics work or what they do. Methadone clinics can be somewhat confusing for people who have never been. That can make it nerve-wracking for anyone considering this form addiction treatment.</p>

                <p class="content6"> <p>There are many things you should know about methadone treatment. We have the answers to your questions.</p>

<p>Methadone is a long acting opioid analgesic. It is chemically very similar to opium. However, it is completely synthetic. Methadone was first created by a group of German scientists in the 1930s. The two scientists were originally looking for a painkiller which didn&#39;t have the addictive effects of morphine. Max Bockmhl &amp; Gustav Ehrhart were the scientists who created polamidon. A shortage in painkillers during World War II prompted a second team of scientists, Max Bockmhl and Gustav Ehrhart, to synthesize the substance. They then changed its name to methadone.</p>

<p>Methadone first arrived in the United States from Europe in 1947 to be used as a pain killer for multiple conditions. It became evident that methadone could be used to treat addictions to narcotics. In the 1960s there was a rise in heroin addiction. Researchers began to search for a way to reduce cravings and symptoms of withdrawal. Methadone was the best candidate.</p>

<p>Methadone helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and suppresses cravings for drugs for up to 24 hours. It does not cause any feelings of euphoria. This medication is typically taken for at most one year. It makes recovery more possible. This form of treatment, also known as methadone Maintenance, is used to treat addiction.</p>

<p>1971 saw the federal government recognize methadone&#39;s effectiveness as a treatment for heroin addiction. They created regulations that governed its use. These regulations remained unchanged until 2001 when the regulations were amended to make it easier for doctors and other health-care professionals to administer methadone consistently to patients. Methadone maintenance treatment is today the gold standard for treating opioid addiction.</p>

<p>Methadone acts as an opioid agonist by attaching to the brain&rsquo;s receptors for opioids. It is a synthetic opioid that activates opioids slower than other opioids. Therefore, it eases withdrawal symptoms but does not give rise to a high in opioid-using addicts. It alters the brain&#39;s pain response, decreasing the pain experienced during opioid withdrawal. Methadone can also block the effects of opioids. This discourages people from using opioids to feel high.<br />

                <p class="content3"><p>A methadone clinic allows people who are addicted to opioids to get treatment. They can also receive the medication they need to help them recover. Since they can also dispense Suboxone(r), methadone clinics may be better known as substance use disorder service clinics (SUDS). But, methadone being the primary medication dispensabled, most people have come to associate the two terms.</p>

<p>All methadone clinic programs have to be certified by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and must also be registered with Drug Enforcement Agency. There were approximately 1,500 methadone clinics across the United States as of 2018. Most were located in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.</p>

<p>There are two types: public and private methadone clinics. The cost of a private clinic is less, but there is limited funding. This means that people end up on a waitinglist. When someone is suffering from addiction, waiting days or even weeks before they can start treatment significantly reduces their chances of returning and increases the chance that they won&rsquo;t receive the help they need.</p>

<p>Private clinics are definitely more expensive but have clear benefits. A private clinic will often have no waiting list, or if it does, it will be very short. Private clinics also offer much better care since staff and physicians are far less likely overworked.</p>

<p>Clinics are required to meet certain federal requirements to gain certification in order for them to dispense methadone and other medications. All clinics must provide a minimum of the following services:</p>

<p>These are just a few of the services that a methadone clinic should offer. The best clinics offer more than just counseling.</p>

<p>Patients suffering from opioid addiction can come to a methadone clinic to request treatment. After the clinic has determined that the patient is eligible through interviews and initial screenings, methadone can be prescribed on-site. Some programs allow patients to self-manage their medication at home after they are approved.</p>
